# Changelog for promise-some

## How the changelog works

1. There is always a `Future` version. As you make changes, add notes there.
2. When a new version is released, the `Future` version is modified to the new version number, and a new `Future` version is created.
3. Organize changelog notes in the following order:
   1. Summary of the new version
   2. Breaking changes
   3. New features
   4. Everything else
4. Write for users of the package, not maintainers.
